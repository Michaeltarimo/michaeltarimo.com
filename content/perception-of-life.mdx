Life, to me, is a continuous journey of learning, unlearning, and growth. It's not about the destination, but the richness of the experiences, the people we meet, and the lessons we gather along the way.

One of the most profound concepts I've come to appreciate is **time**. Time is the canvas on which our stories unfold. Unlike God, who exists outside of time—eternal, unbound, and unchanging—we are placed within a timeline. This isn't a limitation, but a gift. Living on a timeline gives our choices meaning, our growth a direction, and our relationships a sense of urgency and value. Every moment is unique, never to be repeated, and this makes our journey precious.

I believe that every challenge is an opportunity to become more resilient, every failure a lesson in humility, and every success a reminder to stay grateful. The beauty of life lies in its unpredictability and the courage to embrace it with curiosity and hope.

My faith shapes my perspective deeply. The idea that God, who is outside of time, chose to walk with us within our timeline is both humbling and empowering. It means our days matter, our struggles are seen, and our hopes are not in vain. Two passages that continually inspire me are:

> **Psalm 23**: "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want... Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

> **Isaiah 43**: "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you... For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior."

Whether in medicine, technology, or daily living, I strive to approach each day with an open mind and a willingness to make a positive impact—no matter how small. Time is a gift, and I want to use mine well, trusting that my story is part of something much greater.
